<h2>Dark N Gritty 2.0 Documentation</h2>
	
<h3>First and foremost...</h3>
			
			<p>Thank you for your support! We've put a lot of hard work into our themes and we hope you love them as much as we do. If you ever have any questions, have a read through this documentation. If you're still having issues, head over to our support forum at <a href="http://foxhoundbandthemes.com/support" target="_blank">http://foxhoundbandthemes.com/support</a> and we'll help you out. We'd also like to note that while this theme was built with HTML and CSS customization in mind, this theme is sold as-is. Good luck!</p>
			
	<h4>Version 2.0 brought a lot of changes!</h4>
			<p>We made so many changes to the theme...we couldn't even keep track of them all! A lot of the improvements were made under the hood to make the theme run perfectly on the newest version of Wordpress and meet their coding standards. But here are some of the most noticable changes to keep in mind: we added an optional image slider, improved the social links setup, styled Gig Press to look great in our theme, and fixed a ton of bugs. Enjoy!</p>

			
			<h4>Configuring the Add-To-Any Sharing Plugin</h4>
			<p>We developed this theme with a heavy emphasis on sharing. We wanted the most powerful plugin built right into our themes. Unfortunately, when these plugins are updated then tend to overwrite code, leaving the customization out. One thing you will need to do to make sure your theme looks good, is to configure the Add-To-Any plugin.</p>
			
			
			<p>In Wordpress, on the left-hand menu navigate to Settings ï¿½ Share / Save Buttons. In the button section, choose Text Only and type in something like 'Share This' and click 'Save Changes' at the bottom. You're done!</p>
			
			<h4>Photoshop Files</h4>
			<p>We couldn't include the PSDs in the download as the files are very large and not everyone would want them. You can download the PSDs here by finding the link in the read-me file in your download.</p>
